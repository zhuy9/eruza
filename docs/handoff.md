# Resume Eruza

## Request and rules

Continue Stage 1 of Eruza, a personal localhost client for Azure DevOps Boards.
Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/requirements.md`, `docs/architecture.md`,
`docs/api.md`, and `docs/milestones.md`.

For each milestone:

1. Implement the task.
2. Use the installed `ponytail-review` skill on the diff.
3. Fix its findings and review correctness/security separately.
4. Run the required checks and a staged privacy review.
5. Commit locally on `main`, then move to the next milestone.

Do not make product assumptions. Ask if a decision is not covered by the docs.

The user chose mock-mode work first. Build and test the ADO layer with mocked
responses, but leave live acceptance checks open. Do not use the user's Azure
CLI session or real work items yet.

Only the initial plan push was approved. Do not push implementation commits,
deploy, or change repository visibility without explicit approval.

## Git checkpoint

- Branch: `main`. M0 (`34392a6`) is pushed. M1 is committed locally only.
- GitHub was verified private at the M0 push. Keep it private.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a relative symlink to `AGENTS.md`, with Git mode `120000`.

## M1 result: complete

What changed during M1 close-out:

- Moved `MeetingView` into `src/routes/workspace.tsx` (Fast Refresh warning).
- Fixed a `node --watch` restart loop in `npm run dev`: Vite's default config
  loader imports and deletes a temp file. `server/dev.ts` now uses
  `configLoader: 'native'`.
- Removed custom signal handlers. Both servers run in one process, so Ctrl+C
  stops both.
- `ponytail-review` cuts: smaller `.prettierignore`, inlined error handler,
  no `asChild`/Slot in the button, default options removed.
- Correctness fix: the avatar initial now uses the first character.

Evidence (Windows, Node `24.14.1`, npm `11.11.0`):

- `npm run check` passed: lint, format, typecheck, 8 tests, build.
- `npm ci` and `npm run check` passed in a scratch copy of the repo files.
  `npm ci` reported 0 vulnerabilities.
- `npm run test:e2e` passed (1 test): navigation, reload, dark mode,
  keyboard focus, no external requests.
- `npm run dev`: both listeners on `127.0.0.1` only (5173 and 3001).
  `/api/session` through the Vite proxy returned 200. Wrong `Host` and a
  write without origin returned 403. No restarts over 12 idle seconds.
  A real Ctrl+C event stopped both listeners and both Node processes.
- Azure CLI is not installed on this machine, so mock mode ran with it absent.
- Built bundle has no server config, Hono, ADO, or token strings.
- T3 preview showed the shell, Mock mode label, and sample items.

## Local browser setup

The system drive has very little free space. Keep browser downloads, npm cache,
and temp files in the ignored `tmp/` folder:

```sh
export PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$PWD/tmp/ms-playwright"
export TEMP="$PWD/tmp/temp" TMP="$PWD/tmp/temp" npm_config_cache="$PWD/tmp/npm-cache"
npx playwright install --only-shell chromium   # already done
npm run test:e2e
```

`tmp/dev-check.ps1` and `tmp/ctrlc.ps1` are ignored local scripts that repeat
the dev-server and Ctrl+C checks.

## Next steps

1. Start M2 in mock-first mode: `getAuthHeader()`, ADO client, metadata reads,
   WIQL, and batched reads, all tested with mocked `fetch` and credentials.
2. Leave M2.8 (live read check) open. It needs Azure CLI installed, an
   approved test organization, and user approval.
